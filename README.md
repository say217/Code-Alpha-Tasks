## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between **advertising expenditure** across multiple media channels and **product sales**.  
It follows a complete data science workflow, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, outlier handling, and regression-based machine learning to identify the most effective predictors of sales.

The primary objective is to quantify the impact of **TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising** and select the **best-performing regression model** based on predictive accuracy.

---

## Dataset Summary

The dataset contains **200 observations** with advertising spend recorded across three channels and the resulting sales.

| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| TV | Advertising spend on television |
| Radio | Advertising spend on radio |
| Newspaper | Advertising spend on newspapers |
| Sales | Product sales (target variable) |

The dataset is complete, numerically consistent, and contains no missing values.

---

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset was loaded from a CSV file and cleaned by removing an unnecessary index column.  
Data types were verified, and descriptive statistics were computed to assess central tendency and dispersion.

Outlier detection using the **IQR method** identified two extreme observations, which were removed to improve robustness without affecting overall trends.

| Dataset Version | Rows |
|---------------|------|
| Original | 200 |
| Cleaned | 198 |

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis showed that **TV and Radio advertising are approximately symmetrically distributed**, while Newspaper spending exhibits right skewness and mild outliers.  
Sales data shows moderate positive skew but no extreme anomalies.

Bivariate analysis revealed strong linear relationships between advertising spend and sales, particularly for TV advertising.

### Correlation with Sales

| Channel | Pearson Correlation |
|-------|--------------------|
| TV | 0.78 |
| Radio | 0.58 |
| Newspaper | 0.23 |

TV advertising shows the strongest association with sales, while Newspaper advertising has limited predictive value.

## Statistical Modeling (OLS Regression)

A multivariate **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** regression model was used to quantify the combined effect of advertising channels.

Key findings:
- TV and Radio coefficients are **statistically significant**
- Newspaper advertising is **not statistically significant**
- Model explains approximately **89.7% of the variance in sales**

This confirms that TV and Radio are the primary drivers of sales performance.
